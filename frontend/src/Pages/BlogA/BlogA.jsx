          ## Top 10 Pet-Friendly Airlines in 2025: Your Ultimate Guide to Flying
          with Your Furry Friend Traveling with your beloved pet can be a joyous
          experience, but navigating airline policies can feel like a labyrinth.
          As of 2025, many airlines are stepping up their game to accommodate
          our four-legged (or winged!) companions, offering a range of options
          from in-cabin comfort to dedicated cargo services. This comprehensive
          guide highlights the top 10 pet-friendly airlines in 2025, providing
          specific examples of what makes each a great choice for your next
          adventure with your animal. It's crucial to remember that policies can
          change, and specific rules often depend on the animal's size, breed,
          destination, and even the type of aircraft. Always double-check with
          the airline directly and consult with your veterinarian before booking
          to ensure a smooth journey for you and your pet. ### 1. Delta Air
          Lines Delta consistently ranks high for its pet-friendly policies,
          offering options for in-cabin and cargo travel. They have a reputation
          for being accommodating and understanding of pet owners' needs. **Why
          Delta is a good choice:** * **In-Cabin Comfort:** Small dogs, cats,
          and even household birds are welcome in the cabin, provided they fit
          comfortably in an approved carrier under the seat in front of you.
          Delta's policy allows for some flexibility with litters or two
          same-breed animals (ages 8 weeks to 6 months) to travel in one kennel
          if they fit safely. * **Dedicated Cargo Service:** For larger pets,
          Delta Cargo offers a robust shipping service. They prioritize animal
          safety, with specific guidelines for kennel size, temperature
          restrictions, and even requiring acclimation to the crate. This
          service is particularly valuable for military personnel and those with
          larger breeds. * **Clear Guidelines:** Delta provides detailed
          information on their website regarding age requirements (8 weeks for
          domestic, 16 weeks for international cats, 6 months for international
          dogs), health certificates, and kennel specifications. * **Customer
          Feedback:** Many pet owners praise Delta's accommodating nature, with
          some noting that Delta "provides comfort seating" which makes
          traveling with pets easier. **Specific Examples:** Delta allows a
          female cat or dog to travel with her unweaned litter (8 weeks to 6
          months old) in one kennel, as long as they fit safely. They also have
          a clear process for checking in pets at a "Special Service Counter" to
          ensure all requirements are met. ### 2. American Airlines American
          Airlines offers a solid program for pet travel, with options for both
          in-cabin and cargo transport, demonstrating their commitment to
          accommodating furry passengers. **Why American Airlines is a good
          choice:** * **In-Cabin Option:** Small dogs and cats are allowed in
          the cabin, with a limit of seven kennels per flight (five on American
          Eagle flights). The fee is $125 per kennel, and the carrier must fit
          under the seat. * **Cargo Expertise:** American Airlines Cargo is a
          viable option for larger pets. They have strict guidelines for kennel
          construction, health certificates, and even offer complimentary cable
          ties to secure multi-piece kennels. They also require written
          certification that the pet has been fed and watered within four hours
          of departure. * **Comprehensive Information:** Their website provides
          clear instructions on preparing your pet for travel, including
          acclimatization to the carrier and avoiding sedation. * **Safety
          Focus:** American Airlines emphasizes the importance of pet comfort
          and safety, including not accepting sedated or tranquilized pets for
          cargo travel. **Specific Examples:** American Airlines allows up to
          two same-species, similarly sized pets between 8 weeks and 6 months
          old to travel in the same cargo kennel. They also provide a
          straightforward online process for adding a carry-on pet to your
          reservation. ### 3. United Airlines United Airlines has a structured
          pet policy, primarily focusing on in-cabin travel for smaller animals,
          with robust guidelines for service animals. **Why United Airlines is a
          good choice:** * **In-Cabin Pet Program:** Domesticated cats, dogs,
          rabbits, and household birds (excluding cockatoos) can travel in the
          cabin for a fee of $125 each way, plus an additional $125 if stopovers
          exceed four hours. * **Clear Carrier Requirements:** United has
          specific maximum dimensions for both hard-sided and soft-sided
          carriers, ensuring pets can comfortably stand and turn around. *
          **Service Animal Support:** United has clear policies for trained
          service animals, allowing them to travel free of charge and without a
          carrier, provided they meet specific criteria. * **Emphasis on
          Preparation:** United encourages thorough preparation, including
          veterinary checks, carrier familiarity, and proper hydration before
          the flight. **Specific Examples:** While United has suspended its
          PetSafe cargo program for most pets due to safety concerns, they have
          clear guidelines for in-cabin pets, including requiring reservations
          well in advance due to limited spots per flight. ### 4. Southwest
          Airlines Southwest Airlines is known for its straightforward approach,
          extending this to their pet policy, which focuses exclusively on
          in-cabin travel for small dogs and cats. **Why Southwest Airlines is a
          good choice:** * **Simple & Transparent Policy:** Southwest's pet
          policy is easy to understand, focusing solely on small, vaccinated
          cats and dogs in the cabin on domestic flights. This simplicity can be
          a relief for pet owners who prefer a clear-cut process. * **Affordable
          Fee:** A flat fee of $95 each way for in-cabin pets makes budgeting
          predictable. * **Open Seating Advantage:** While not explicitly a "pet
          policy" feature, Southwest's open seating often allows pet owners to
          find window seats with more floor space for their carriers, minimizing
          disruption. * **High Customer Satisfaction:** Many pet parents report
          positive experiences, noting Southwest's "easy seating when traveling
          with my dog" and its reputation as "America's most reliable for pet
          travel." **Specific Examples:** Southwest offers its own branded pet
          carriers for purchase, which meet their maximum dimensions (17" L x
          10" W x 9.5" H). They also advise calling Southwest to add your pet to
          your reservation *after* booking your own ticket, and paying the pet
          fare at the airport counter. ### 5. JetBlue Airways JetBlue, with its
          focus on customer comfort, extends this philosophy to pets through its
          "JetPaws" program, offering a few perks for in-cabin pet travelers.
          **Why JetBlue is a good choice:** * **"JetPaws" Program:** This
          program offers pet parents 300 TrueBlue points for every pet flown and
          provides a helpful "JetPaws" bag tag for your carrier, adding a touch
          of personalized service. * **Most Legroom in Coach:** JetBlue boasts
          the most legroom in coach, which can be a significant advantage when
          stowing a pet carrier under the seat, providing more space for both
          you and your furry friend. * **Clear Restrictions:** While limited to
          small dogs and cats, JetBlue's policy is transparent about weight
          limits (combined pet and carrier not exceeding 20 lbs) and carrier
          dimensions (max 17" L x 12.5" W x 8.5" H). * **Online Booking:** You
          can easily add your pet to your booking online or via the JetBlue app.
          **Specific Examples:** JetBlue limits the number of pets to six per
          flight, emphasizing the importance of booking early. They also
          explicitly state that pets are not allowed in Mint (first-class)
          cabin. ### 6. Alaska Airlines Alaska Airlines has historically been
          one of the more pet-friendly airlines, though recent changes to their
          cabin seat baggage policy for pets should be noted. They still offer
          good options for both in-cabin and cargo travel. **Why Alaska Airlines
          is a good choice:** * **Diverse Pet Acceptance (Cargo):** Beyond dogs
          and cats, Alaska Airlines accepts a wider range of domesticated pets
          in their climate-controlled baggage and cargo compartments, including
          ferrets, guinea pigs, hamsters, household birds, non-poisonous
          reptiles, pot-bellied pigs, rabbits, and tropical fish (with specific
          restrictions for Hawaii and international travel). * **In-Cabin
          Availability:** Dogs, cats, rabbits, and household birds are generally
          permitted in the cabin, with limits of 3 pets in first class and 8 in
          coach. * **"Fur-st Class" Travel (Concept):** While the actual cabin
          seat baggage option for larger pets is being phased out, Alaska
          Airlines has long promoted a pet-friendly image, hinting at their
          overall commitment to animal welfare. * **Military Benefits:** Reduced
          fees for active U.S. military or dependents on travel orders.
          **Specific Examples:** While the option for pets as "cabin seat
          baggage" is being eliminated as of June 4, 2025, Alaska Airlines
          continues to offer robust cargo services with careful attention to
          temperature restrictions and health certificate requirements. For
          in-cabin pets, they remind owners that "odorous or noisy animals must
          travel in the baggage compartment," reinforcing the importance of
          proper grooming and training. ### 7. Lufthansa Lufthansa, a major
          European carrier, offers a comprehensive pet travel program for
          international journeys, accommodating pets in the cabin, as checked
          baggage, and through cargo services. **Why Lufthansa is a good
          choice:** * **Multiple Travel Options:** Lufthansa provides
          flexibility, allowing small dogs and cats in the cabin, larger pets as
          checked baggage, and even offers a dedicated cargo service for
          unaccompanied animals or those exceeding checked baggage limits. *
          **IATA Compliance:** They adhere to International Air Transport
          Association (IATA) standards for pet carriers, ensuring a high level
          of safety and comfort for animals. * **Frankfurt Animal Lounge:** For
          pets traveling through Frankfurt with long stopovers, Lufthansa offers
          the "Animal Lounge," a dedicated facility providing watering, feeding,
          and walking services, significantly reducing stress for animals during
          transit. * **Clear International Guidelines:** Lufthansa provides
          detailed information on required documentation, vaccinations, and
          microchipping for international travel, which can be complex.
          **Specific Examples:** Lufthansa has a weight limit of 8 kg (17.6 lbs)
          for pets in the cabin, including the carrier. They also have a list of
          certain dog breeds classified as dangerous that are not permitted in
          the cabin but can travel as checked baggage in specialized crates. ###
          8. Air France Air France is another strong European contender,
          offering diverse pet travel solutions and focusing on animal
          well-being during international flights. **Why Air France is a good
          choice:** * **In-Cabin and Hold Options:** Air France allows small
          dogs and cats in the cabin (under 8 kg/17.64 lbs with carrier) and
          larger dogs and cats in the hold (up to 75 kg/165.35 lbs with kennel).
          * **International Travel Expertise:** They provide extensive guidance
          on international travel requirements, including microchipping and
          European pet passports for travel within the EU, and advise contacting
          embassies for specific country regulations. * **Health and Hygiene
          Focus:** Air France emphasizes the need for all required vaccinations
          and health certificates, and for service dogs, they may request proof
          of the owner's ability to care for the dog's hygiene needs on long
          flights. * **Dedicated Booking Request:** For pets in the hold,
          bookings must be made at least 24 hours before departure, with a
          longer lead time for service dogs on certain routes. **Specific
          Examples:** Air France requires in-cabin pet carriers to be no larger
          than 46 cm x 28 cm x 24 cm (18 in x 11 in x 9 in). They also clearly
          state that dogs classified as Category 1 by the French Ministry of
          Agriculture (certain dangerous breeds) are not allowed to be
          transported. ### 9. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines KLM provides a structured
          and informative approach to pet travel, with clear guidelines for both
          in-cabin and hold transport, particularly for international routes.
          **Why KLM is a good choice:** * **Comprehensive Information:** KLM's
          website is well-organized, offering detailed information on pet
          reservations, kennel requirements, and pre-travel preparation. *
          **Multiple Pets in Hold:** Unlike some airlines, KLM allows up to
          three pets to travel in the hold if they are from the same litter (up
          to 6 months old) or two adult animals of comparable size, provided
          they weigh no more than 14 kg each and share the same kennel. * **No
          Sedation Policy:** KLM strongly advises against tranquilizing pets,
          prioritizing their natural acclimatization to the travel environment.
          * **European Union Compliance:** For travel within the EU, they
          emphasize the necessity of electronic microchips and European
          passports, ensuring compliance with regional regulations. **Specific
          Examples:** KLM specifies maximum kennel dimensions for both regular
          KLM flights and KLM Cityhopper flights (operated with Embraer
          aircraft), showing attention to aircraft-specific limitations. They
          also have a clear list of snub-nosed dog breeds that are not permitted
          to travel in the hold due to health risks. ### 10. Hawaiian Airlines
          For those looking to explore the beautiful Hawaiian islands with their
          pets, Hawaiian Airlines offers specific guidelines for in-cabin and
          cargo travel, navigating the unique quarantine requirements for entry
          into Hawaii. **Why Hawaiian Airlines is a good choice:** *
          **Inter-island and North America Travel:** Hawaiian Airlines
          facilitates pet travel on routes within Hawaii and between Hawaii and
          North America, a crucial service for residents and tourists alike. *
          **Hawaii Quarantine Guidance:** They provide specific instructions and
          coordination with the State of Hawaii's Animal Industry Division,
          which is essential for managing the island's strict animal import
          regulations. * **In-Cabin Flexibility:** While generally limited to
          one pet per carrier in the cabin, they allow two puppies or kittens of
          the same breed (8 weeks to 6 months old) in a single carrier, provided
          it meets size requirements. * **Focus on Pet Comfort and Behavior:**
          Hawaiian Airlines emphasizes that pets must show no visible signs of
          illness or discomfort and must be well-behaved, with no excessive
          barking or disruptive behavior, ensuring a pleasant experience for all
          passengers. **Specific Examples:** Hawaiian Airlines prohibits pets
          from traveling in the cabin on certain routes (e.g., international
          locations, JFK, BOS, AUS, SLC) and in specific seating areas like
          First Class on North America to Hawaii flights. They also clearly
          state that for flights arriving in Honolulu before Animal Quarantine
          opens, you and your pet must remain in the terminal with a Hawaiian
          Airlines agent until the facility is open. ### Essential Tips for
          Traveling with Your Pet No matter which airline you choose, proper
          preparation is key to a stress-free journey for both you and your pet.
          * **Vet Visit:** Schedule a check-up with your veterinarian well in
          advance. Obtain a health certificate (often required within 10 days of
          travel) and discuss any concerns about your pet's ability to handle
          air travel. * **Crate Training:** Familiarize your pet with their
          airline-approved carrier weeks or even months before the flight. Make
          it a comfortable, positive space with treats and toys. *
          **Identification:** Ensure your pet has proper identification tags on
          their collar and is microchipped. * **Hydration & Feeding:** Offer
          water regularly but a light meal a few hours before departure. Avoid
          large meals directly before the flight. * **Exercise:** A tired pet is
          a calm pet! Give your furry friend plenty of exercise before heading
          to the airport. * **Avoid Sedation:** Most airlines and veterinarians
          advise against sedating pets for air travel, as it can interfere with
          their ability to regulate body temperature and react to changes in air
          pressure. * **Know the Rules:** Read your chosen airline's pet policy
          thoroughly and be prepared for potential fees, restrictions, and
          documentation requirements. * **Arrive Early:** Allow ample time at
          the airport for check-in and any necessary pet inspections. By doing
          your homework and preparing adequately, you can ensure that your next
          adventure with your beloved pet is a memorable and enjoyable one.
          Happy travels!
